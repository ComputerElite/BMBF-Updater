# BMBF-Updater
A little tool do do semi automatic BMBF Updating.
# How-to
**DON'T CLOSE THE PROGRAM WHILE UPDATEING OR YOU LOOSE ALL SCORES AND PLALIST SORTING. Use [BMBF and Beat Saber Backup Utility](https://github.com/ComputerElite/BMBF-BS-Backup-Utility) if you want to do a full Backup.**</br>
Connect your Quest to your PC via a USB Cable. Then start "BMBF_Updater.exe" and put in your Quests IP. Then click "Uninstall BMBF and BS" and wait until it has finished. Then you run Beat Saber once and Fail a Song. After you did this quit Beat Saber and click "Install BMBF". It'll download the newest BMBF Version and install it. After it has finished you go to the unknown sources on your Quest and launch BMBF. Do everything exactly as mentioned. After you finished modding Beat Saber and tested it you click "Restore Playlists" if you want to restore your old Playlists. If you want to restore your old Scores open Sidequest, click the 9 squares and then "Beat Saber". From there click the reload arrows besides "Backup". Now Enjoy.
